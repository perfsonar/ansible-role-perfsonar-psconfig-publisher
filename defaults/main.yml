# defaults file for perfsonar-psconfig-publisher

# In order to publish a mesh, give it an entry in the
# perfsonar_psconfig_publish_meshes list.  The subelements
# are as follows:
#
# mesh: required.  filename of mesh defined in json file.
#
# remote_dir: defaults to /tmp.  directory on target machine for json file.
#
# remote_agents: defaults to [].  a list of Ansible managed machines.
#   Ansible will try to use psconfig on each host to add the published
#   mesh's URL.  You can add Ansible host groups.
#
# remote_configure_archives: default to False.  Set to True if you want the
#   remote_agents to send results to archivers defined in the json mesh file.
#
# remote_url: if this is set, get the json file from the URL not locally
#
# perfsonar_psconfig_publish_meshes:
#   - mesh: filename
#     remote_url: url
#     remote_dir: /tmp
#     remote_agents: "{{ groups['ps-maddash'] }}
#       + {{ groups['ps-toolkits'] }}
#       + {{ groups['ps-testpoints'] }}"
#     remote_configure_archives: True
